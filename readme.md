## Description

_Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":_
*_If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn._
*_If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues._
*_If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn._

|Behavior   |Input Example   |Output Example   |
|---|---|---|
|Player rolls 2-6 on dice and adds to turn total.   |roll 2   |2 + turn total  |

|Player holds, turn total is added to total score. Turn Ends.   |player ends turn  |turn total added to total score. Turn ends.   |
